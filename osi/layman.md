# üåê What is the OSI Model?

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework used to understand how different networking protocols interact in a layered fashion.

It has 7 layers, each with specific functions, going from physical hardware to user applications.

## üìö The 7 OSI Layers (from bottom to top):

| Layer | Name         | Function (What it Does)                     | Examples                          |
|-------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 7     | Application  | User interface, end-user services           | HTTP, FTP, DNS, SSH, SMTP         |
| 6     | Presentation | Data format, encryption, compression        | SSL/TLS, JPEG, ASCII              |
| 5     | Session      | Session control, connection establishment & termination | NetBIOS, RPC             |
| 4     | Transport    | End-to-end communication, error checking    | TCP, UDP                          |
| 3     | Network      | Routing, logical addressing                 | IP, ICMP                          |
| 2     | Data Link    | MAC addressing, error detection in frames   | Ethernet, PPP, MAC               |
| 1     | Physical     | Actual hardware transmission of raw bits    | Cables, switches, NICs, fiber     |

## üß† Easy Mnemonic:

From Layer 7 to 1 (Top to Bottom):

**"All People Seem To Need Data Processing"**

- Application  
- Presentation  
- Session  
- Transport  
- Network  
- Data Link  
- Physical

## üö¶ Real-Life Analogy (Sending a Letter):

| OSI Layer   | Analogy                                               |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Application | You writing a letter                                   |
| Presentation| Translating it to a common language (e.g., English)    |
| Session     | Starting and ending the conversation                   |
| Transport   | Choosing a reliable courier (e.g., FedEx with tracking)|
| Network     | Determining the best delivery path                     |
| Data Link   | Adding delivery address and sender info to envelope    |
| Physical    | Putting the letter in a mailbox for physical delivery  |

## üõ†Ô∏è Use in Troubleshooting

- **Ping fails**: Check **Layer 3 (Network ‚Äì IP)**
- **Webpage not loading**: Could be **Layer 7 (Application ‚Äì HTTP)**
- **Cable unplugged**: **Layer 1 (Physical)**
- **MAC address issue**: **Layer 2 (Data Link)**
